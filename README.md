This is a small R program that I wrote based on what I have learned from course Marketing Analytics Using R at school.

This program uses a dataset which gives the characteristics of applicants to a major credit card. 
The key dependent variable is card , which indicates whether a consumer was approved for a credit card. 
The remaining variables contain other relevant information about each consumer. 
The data on real world setting that appeared in G reene, 2003 .

The idea of this program is to estimate a predictive model to predict whether a consumer is approved for a credit card.
This might be useful to a firm that is selecting which consumers to target, choosing how much to pay for the contact information of a consumer, 
or a firm that is simply trying to forecast demand. Firms with better predictive models will be able to more efficiently target consumers, or make better
purchasing decisions. 

In this program, I used linear regressions and MARS models. I estimiated 10 models with cross-validation and chose the model with best performance.
